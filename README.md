# browse-by-netflixers
![Logo](logo128.png)

`en-us` | [pt-br](https://github.com/TimeoutZero/browse-by-netflixers/blob/master/README_pt-br.md)

## Description
Netflix offers it's categories according to what the user watches. However, there are some secret categories which are not displayed in the navigation menu. This extension enables a new menu with all hidden categories! =)

Available in English and Portuguese! (according to the browser's default language).

## Step by Step
After installation:

1 - go to NETFLIX website: (www.netflix.com)

2 - On the main page (www.netflix.com/browse) the new browse-by-netflixers logo must show up to left of the original browse icon and holding the new categories within.
<b>If the logo doesn't show up immediately, just reload the page.</b>

Note: Hover the mouse over the menu. All you gotta do now is look for any category you enjoy and click the link to open it. You can also filter the categories through the text box.

## Legal Warning
NETFLIX is a registered company and this extension is made by fans, NETFLIX has nothing to do with it. =D
